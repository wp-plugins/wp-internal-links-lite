No Sweat WP Internal Links Lite allows you to create silos, powerful internal linking structures that improve your on-site SEO.

== Description ==

WP Internal Links Lite lets you create Internal Links that Google *LOVES* among your posts and pages!

You can see a demo of the plugin in action here:

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzV5uzjmXbQ]

You can quickly and easily create internal Linking Structures **over which you have absolute control**:

1. Choose the introductory text that will be placed before the links, like "For more information, visit..."

2. Place the links at the top or the bottom of your posts. Thus, they are *high valued in-content links*.

3. Be Penguin-safe, and *choose the specific anchor text you want to use to link to each post*. You can vary it as much as you want!

4. Have your posts and pages point to one another, creating "silo" rings... It can be done in less than one minute!

5. Conveniently access all existing structures, and review them. Never again forget what post links to what others, never again have to edit each of your existing links manually!

6. No need to edit your theme's templates or mess up with coding, as links are added dynamically when the post is viewed.

NOTE: This free Lite version is fully functional, but comes with two limitations:

1. You can *only create one of the four types of structures* available in the PRO version. You can create Rings, but not Hubs, Webs or Stars.

2. You can't *edit structures you have created*, in the Lite version you will have to delete and re-create them if you want to change any values.

3. In the PRO version you can place the links anywhere you want using a shortcode, beyond the general "top of the post" or "bottom of the post" allowed by the Lite version

If you want to unleash the full potential of the plugin, you can do it by checking the PRO version of [No Sweat WP Internal Links](http://nosweatplugins.com/get-no-sweat-wp-internal-links-pro/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=salespage "WP Internal Links")

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin by either:

    a) Uploading the ZIP file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of yur site via FTP.

    b) Using the built-in "Add new" functionality in the Wordpress "Plugins" admin menu, searching for "WP Internal Links Lite", and clicking on "install" on its listing.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. And that's it! Go through the tutorial videos recommended in the plugin's main screen to learn how to use it to its maximum potential!

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why can I only create Rings but not Hubs, Webs or Stars? =

This is a limitation of the Lite version. If you upgrade to the full PRO version you will be able to create the four of them.
